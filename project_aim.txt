Create a web app that takes text as input and analyses it. The analysis should contain: 1. POS (part of speech) tagging 2. NER (name entity recognition) 3. Sentiment classification You are free to use any language of preference for the backend and frontend also you are free to choose any database of your choice. Tasks Expectations: 1. The user should be provided with a clean interface to input the text and get the analysis 2. Figure out a neat way to display the analysis to the user on the UI 3. Design database tables to store the analysis to avoid computing it again. In case the user enters the same text again the results should be fetched from the DB 4. Create a small dashboard pagethath should show the usage summary of the webapp, the dashboard should show: 1. Number of times the web-app was used for analysis 2. Number of sentences that are stored in the database 3. Number of different positive and negative sentences that are stored in the database 4. What is the average length of sentences that the users input? 5. Provide a simple README file which can help deploy your code locally 6. Brownie task: Host the web-app on a server which can be accessed over the internet (there are many free web-hosting services available) Hint - In case you use Python look at libraries like SPACY and NLTK which are brilliant for text analysis.
